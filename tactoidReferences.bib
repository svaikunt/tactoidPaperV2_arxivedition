abstract="A tactoid phase is obtained, which is an anisotropic mesophase dispersed in an anisotropic solution. A model is constructed that describes the shape of anisotropic regions, i.e., tactoids. It is demonstrated that the prolate shape of tactoids is caused by the competition between the elastic energy of the nematic phase and the surface energy. This model is used to find the ratio of elastic constants K3/K1 from the experimental data. It is experimentally found that a magnetic field orients and stretches tactoids. An explanation of this phenomenon is suggested.",

abstract = "Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed."

Investigations were made in the membranes with quadrupolar droplets. Large droplets are nearly circular, whereas small droplets become elongated. The elongation of the droplets increases with decreasing droplet size. At high temperature the droplets are found to be spindlelike with two cusps on their boundary. The observed transformations are explained by the competition between the elastic energy of the director field and the surface tension of the interface between the droplets and the smectic membrane.}

	abstract = {In many colloidal systems, an orientationally ordered nematic (N) phase emerges from the isotropic (I) melt in the form of spindle-like birefringent tactoids. In cases studied so far, the tactoids always reveal a mirror-symmetric nonchiral structure, sometimes even when the building units are chiral. We report on chiral symmetry breaking in the nematic tactoids formed in molecularly nonchiral polymer-crowded aqueous solutions of low-molecular weight disodium cromoglycate. The parity is broken by twisted packing of self-assembled molecular aggregates within the tactoids as manifested by the observed optical activity. Fluorescent confocal microscopy reveals that the chiral N tactoids are located at the boundaries of cells. We explain the chirality induction as a replacement of energetically costly splay packing of the aggregates within the curved bipolar tactoidal shape with twisted packing. The effect represents a simple pathway of macroscopic chirality induction in an organic system with no molecular chirality, as the only requirements are orientational order and curved shape of confinement.},

	abstract = {Liquid crystals (LCs) are anisotropic, viscoelastic fluids that can be used to direct colloids (e.g., metallic nanorods) into organized assemblies with unusual optical, mechanical, and electrical properties. In past studies, the colloids have been sufficiently rigid that their individual shapes and properties have not been strongly coupled to elastic stresses imposed by the LCs. Herein, we explore how soft colloids (micrometer-sized shells formed from phospholipids) behave in LCs. We reveal a sharing of strain between the LC and shells, resulting in formation of spindle-like shells and other complex shapes and also, tuning of properties of the shells (e.g., barrier properties). These results hint at previously unidentified designs of reconfigurable soft materials with applications in sensing and biology.Liquid crystals (LCs), because of their long-range molecular ordering, are anisotropic, elastic fluids. Herein, we report that elastic stresses imparted by nematic LCs can dynamically shape soft colloids and tune their physical properties. Specifically, we use giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as soft colloids and explore the interplay of mechanical strain when the GUVs are confined within aqueous chromonic LC phases. Accompanying thermal quenching from isotropic to LC phases, we observe the elasticity of the LC phases to transform initially spherical GUVs (diameters of 2{\textendash}50 {\textmu}m) into two distinct populations of GUVs with spindle-like shapes and aspect ratios as large as 10. Large GUVs are strained to a small extent (R/r \&lt; 1.54, where R and r are the major and minor radii, respectively), consistent with an LC elasticity-induced expansion of lipid membrane surface area of up to 3\% and conservation of the internal GUV volume. Small GUVs, in contrast, form highly elongated spindles (1.54 \&lt; R/r \&lt; 10) that arise from an efflux of LCs from the GUVs during the shape transformation, consistent with LC-induced straining of the membrane leading to transient membrane pore formation. A thermodynamic analysis of both populations of GUVs reveals that the final shapes adopted by these soft colloids are dominated by a competition between the LC elasticity and an energy (\~{}0.01 mN/m) associated with the GUV{\textendash}LC interface. Overall, these results provide insight into the coupling of strain in soft materials and suggest previously unidentified designs of LC-based responsive and reconfigurable materials.},

abstract = "Amyloid fibrils, nanocellulose and filamentous viruses are three important families of filamentous biological colloids exhibiting a rich phase behavior in two and three dimensions. Similarly to the entropy-driven crystallization of hard spheres into crystals, also in their case entropy triggers order–order transitions at increasing concentrations, but their high aspect ratio, semiflexible and chiral nature bring additional complexity to the phase diagram and in some cases, system-specific features. Some of the differences among these three classes of filamentous colloids arise from their own constitutive nature and their mesoscopic structure; however, other features are universally shared among them and can be understood by applying general liquid crystal theories in bulk or confined geometries. In this manuscript we review the main analogies and differences among these three classes of biological filamentous colloids, starting from a discussion on their chemical composition and progressing across length scales to discuss first their mesoscopic structure and then their colloidal behavior, with particular emphasis to their lyotropic liquid crystalline features. By doing so, we highlight the main tools available to tune the colloidal properties, from the onset of the isotropic-nematic transition and the width of its biphasic region, to the shape transformations and director field distribution in the ensued liquid crystalline droplets, to the way chirality is transferred from the constitutive colloidal particles to the final macroscopic liquid crystalline phases."

By optimising the bulk elastic and surface energies, we find that the director field crosses over smoothly from a homogeneous to a bipolar configuration with increasing droplet size, in a process that we postulate to involve two virtual point defects that move in from infinity towards the poles on the surface of the droplet. Our calculations show that these hypothesised virtual defects become true surface point defects or boojums only in the limit of infinite droplet volume, and that the more elongated the droplets are, the larger their volume has to be before a uniform director field distorts so as to become discernibly bipolar. The theory agrees well with available experimental data on the size dependence of the aspect ratio of tactoids.",

Similarly, liquid crystal ordering is important in contexts ranging from biological membranes to laboratory models of cosmic strings and liquid crystal displays in consumer devices. Some of the most exciting recent developments in both of these soft matter fields emerge at their interface, in the fast-growing research arena of liquid crystal colloids. Mesoscale self-assembly in such systems may lead to artificial materials and to structures with emergent physical behavior arising from patterning of molecular order and nano- or microparticles into precisely controlled configurations. Liquid crystal colloids show exceptional promise for new discovery that may impinge on composite material fabrication, low-dimensional topology, photonics, and so on. Starting from physical underpinnings, I review the state of the art in this fast-growing field, with a focus on its scientific and technological potential. }

The equations are described in a high-level XML-based script, and the package generates low-level optionally parallelised C++ code for the efficient solution of those equations. It combines the advantages of high-level simulations, namely fast and low-error development, with the speed, portability and scalability of hand-written code. XMDS2 is a complete redesign of the XMDS package, and features support for a much wider problem space while also producing faster code.

	abstract = {The interior of biological cells is composed of soft, macromolecular-based materials. The semiflexible biopolymer actin cross-links into networks and bundles with diverse architectures to form the actin cytoskeleton. Actin networks have been traditionally thought to be viscoelastic gels, whose rigidity controls cell morphogenesis. Here we demonstrate that cross-linked actin filaments also form liquid droplets. Because these liquids are composed of rod-like polymers, they form anisotropic liquid droplets with a spindle-like shape, whose morphology can be controlled by cross-link concentration. Actin-based liquid bundles also display shape instabilities characteristic of fluids. These shape dynamics reveal a mechanism to control subcellular compartmentalization and dynamics, with implications for mitotic spindle shape and molecular motor-independent contractility.The actin cytoskeleton is a critical regulator of cytoplasmic architecture and mechanics, essential in a myriad of physiological processes. Here we demonstrate a liquid phase of actin filaments in the presence of the physiological cross-linker, filamin. Filamin condenses short actin filaments into spindle-shaped droplets, or tactoids, with shape dynamics consistent with a continuum model of anisotropic liquids. We find that cross-linker density controls the droplet shape and deformation timescales, consistent with a variable interfacial tension and viscosity. Near the liquid{\textendash}solid transition, cross-linked actin bundles show behaviors reminiscent of fluid threads, including capillary instabilities and contraction. These data reveal a liquid droplet phase of actin, demixed from the surrounding solution and dominated by interfacial tension. These results suggest a mechanism to control organization, morphology, and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton.},

	abstract = {Self-organized and shape-changing assemblies are fundamental in living systems. However, in synthetic materials, these features remain elusive to reconstruct. Here, we construct liquid droplets out of biological proteins actin and myosin, which are fundamental cellular materials. Since the proteins form filaments, the droplets have internal structure. This structure leads to the self-organization of the protein components, where myosin finds the center of actin droplets, reminiscent of chromosome alignment in cell division. Myosin also strongly interacts with actin, leading to spontaneous shape change and droplet division. These results suggest physical mechanisms of biological processes, while inspiring strategies for soft materials design.The cytoskeleton is a collection of protein assemblies that dynamically impose spatial structure in cells and coordinate processes such as cell division and mechanical regulation. Biopolymer filaments, cross-linking proteins, and enzymatically active motor proteins collectively self-organize into various precise cytoskeletal assemblies critical for specific biological functions. An outstanding question is how the precise spatial organization arises from the component macromolecules. We develop a system to investigate simple physical mechanisms of self-organization in biological assemblies. Using a minimal set of purified proteins, we create droplets of cross-linked biopolymer filaments. Through the addition of enzymatically active motor proteins, we construct composite assemblies, evocative of cellular structures such as spindles, where the inherent anisotropy drives motor self-organization, droplet deformation, and division into two droplets. These results suggest that simple physical principles underlie self-organization in complex biological assemblies and inform bioinspired materials design.},

abstract = {The spontaneous positioning of colloids on the surfaces of micrometer-sized liquid crystal (LC) droplets and their subsequent polymerization offers the basis of a general and facile method for the synthesis of patchy microparticles. The existence of multiple local energetic minima, however, can generate kinetic traps for colloids on the surfaces of the LC droplets and result in heterogeneous populations of patchy microparticles. To address this issue, herein it is demonstrated that adsorbate-driven switching of the internal configurations of LC droplets can be used to sweep colloids to a single location on the LC droplet surfaces, thus resulting in the synthesis of homogeneous populations of patchy microparticles. The surface-driven switching of the LC can be triggered by addition of surfactant or salts, and permits the synthesis of dipolar microparticles as well as “Janus-like” microparticles. By using magnetic colloids, the utility of the approach is illustrated by synthesizing magnetically responsive patchy microdroplets of LC with either dipolar or quadrupolar symmetry that exhibit distinct optical responses upon application of an external magnetic field.},

abstract  ="Microtubule self-organization is an essential physical process underlying several essential cellular functions{,} including cell division. In cell division{,} the dominant arrangement is the mitotic spindle{,} a football-shaped microtubule-based machine responsible for separating the chromosomes. We are interested in the underlying fundamental principles behind the self-organization of the spindle shape. Prior biological works have hypothesized that motor proteins control the proper formation of the spindle. Many of these motor proteins are also microtubule-crosslinkers{,} so it is unclear if the critical aspect is the motor activity or the crosslinking. In this study{,} we seek to address this question by examining the self-organization of microtubules using crosslinkers alone. We use a minimal system composed of tubulin{,} an antiparallel microtubule-crosslinking protein{,} and a crowding agent to explore the phase space of organizations as a function of tubulin and crosslinker concentration. We find that the concentration of the antiparallel crosslinker{,} MAP65{,} has a significant effect on the organization and resulted in spindle-like arrangements at relatively low concentration without the need for motor activity. Surprisingly{,} the length of the microtubules only moderately affects the equilibrium phase. We characterize both the shape and dynamics of these spindle-like organizations. We find that they are birefringent homogeneous tactoids. The microtubules have slow mobility{,} but the crosslinkers have fast mobility within the tactoids. These structures represent a first step in the recapitulation of self-organized spindles of microtubules that can be used as initial structures for further biophysical and active matter studies relevant to the biological process of cell division."}

abstract={The ability to dictate the motion of microscopic objects is an important challenge in fields ranging from materials science to biology. Field-directed assembly drives microparticles along paths defined by energy gradients. Nematic liquid crystals, consisting of rod-like molecules, provide new opportunities in this domain. Deviations of nematic liquid crystal molecules from uniform orientation cost elastic energy, and such deviations can be molded by bounding vessel shape. Here, by placing a wavy wall in a nematic liquid crystal, we impose alternating splay and bend distortions, and define a smoothly varying elastic energy field. A microparticle in this field displays a rich set of behaviors, as this system has multiple stable states, repulsive and attractive loci, and interaction strengths that can be tuned to allow reconfigurable states. Microparticles can transition between defect configurations, move along distinct paths, and select sites for preferred docking. Such tailored landscapes have promise in reconfigurable systems and in microrobotics applications.},

Capillary interactions provide a versatile route for structure formation. Colloids adsorbed on fluid interfaces distort the interface, which creates an associated energy field.

Developing a general understanding of their structure in relation to the underlying nonequilibrium physics would provide a route toward control of their dynamic behavior and pave the way for potential applications. The active system considered here consists of a quasi{\textendash}two-dimensional sheet of short (≈1 μm) actin filaments driven by myosin II motors. By adopting a concerted theoretical and experimental strategy, new insights are gained into the nonequilibrium properties of active nematics over a wide range of internal activity levels. In particular, it is shown that topological defect interactions can be led to transition from attractive to repulsive as a function of initial defect separation and relative orientation. Furthermore, by examining the +1/2 defect morphology as a function of activity, we found that the apparent elastic properties of the system (the ratio of bend-to-splay elastic moduli) are altered considerably by increased activity, leading to an effectively lower bend elasticity. At high levels of activity, the topological defects that decorate the material exhibit a liquid-like structure and adopt preferred orientations depending on their topological charge. Together, these results suggest that it should be possible to tune internal stresses in active nematic systems with the goal of designing out-of-equilibrium structures with engineered dynamic responses.},

abstract={In cells, many vital processes involve myosin-driven motility that actively remodels the actin cytoskeleton and changes cell shape. Here we study how the collective action of myosin motors organizes actin filaments into contractile structures in a simplified model system devoid of biochemical regulation. We show that this self-organization occurs through an active multistage coarsening process. First, motors form dense foci by moving along the actin network structure followed by coalescence. Then the foci accumulate actin filaments in a shell around them. These actomyosin condensates eventually cluster due to motor-driven coalescence. We propose that the physical origin of this multistage aggregation is the highly asymmetric load response of actin filaments: they can support large tensions but buckle easily under piconewton compressive loads. Because the motor-generated forces well exceed this threshold, buckling is induced on the connected actin network that resists motor-driven filament sliding. We show how this buckling can give rise to the accumulation of actin shells around myosin foci and subsequent coalescence of foci into superaggregates. This new physical mechanism provides an explanation for the formation and contractile dynamics of disordered condensed actomyosin states observed in vivo.},

abstract = "Cells assemble a variety of bundled actomyosin structures in the cytoskeleton for activities such as cell-shape regulation, force production, and cytokinesis. Although these linear structures exhibit varied architecture, two common organizational themes are a punctate distribution of myosin II and distinct patterns of actin polarity. The mechanisms that cells use to assemble and maintain these organizational features are poorly understood. To study these, we reconstituted actomyosin bundles in vitro that contained only actin filaments and myosin II. Upon addition of ATP, the bundles contracted and the uniformly distributed myosin spontaneously reorganized into discrete clusters. We developed a mathematical model in which the motion of myosin II filaments is governed by the polarities of the actin filaments with which they interact. The model showed that the assembly of myosins into clusters is driven by their tendency to migrate to locations with zero net actin filament polarity. With no fitting parameters, the predicted distribution of myosin cluster separations was in close agreement with our experiments, including a −3/2 power law decay for intermediate length scales. Thus, without an organizing template or accessory proteins, a minimal bundle of actin and myosin has the inherent capacity to self-organize into a heterogeneous banded structure."

abstract  ="Building on the striking similarity between the structure of the spindle during mitosis in living cells and nematic textures in confined liquid crystals{,} we use a continuum model of two-dimensional nematic liquid crystal droplets to examine the physical aspects of cell division. The model investigates the interplay between bulk elasticity of the microtubule assembly{,} described as a nematic liquid crystal{,} and surface elasticity of the cell cortex{,} modeled as a bounding flexible membrane{,} in controlling cell shape and division. The centrosomes at the spindle poles correspond to the cores of the topological defects required to accommodate nematic order in a closed geometry. We map out the progression of both healthy bipolar and faulty multi-polar division as a function of an effective parameter that incorporates active processes and controls centrosome separation. A robust prediction{,} independent of energetic considerations{,} is that the transition from a single cell to daughters cells occurs at critical value of this parameter. Our model additionally suggests that microtubule anchoring at the cell cortex may play an important role for successful bipolar division. This can be tested experimentally by regulating microtubule anchoring."}
